Cheetah is a custom-made electronic hacking device which provides offensive and defensive tools to interact
with Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and/or RF-433 MHz devices. It's made entire from me with educational purposes only, I like
to do electronics, programming and ethical hacking, so it fits perfectly the things I like to do.
The project is currently in development and (for the moment) has no intentions to be commercialized.

I let you know that I spend some of my free time to keep developing this, and it can take a long time to finish it
(I'm a Software Engineering student btw, so usually I don't have much time to do things).

Here are some images of the first prototype:

I'm going to make a Wiki to explain how is it made and what I plan to do with it, like all the features and stuff,
and which are the hardware capabilities and limitations.
